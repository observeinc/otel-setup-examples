# otel-setup-examples

Repo with OpenTelemetry setup examples for different programming languages and frameworks

You should structure the examples like this:
```
<language>
â”œâ”€â”€ <framework>_otel_setup.<language_extension>
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

In the `README.md` you should detail which dependencies are needed and any relevant information regarding how to setup OpenTelemetry for that language and for the frameworks you are setting as examples. The README should link to the framework's setup file.

An example of README structure:
- ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- ðŸ”§ Configuration Overview
- ðŸ§ª <Framework> Application Example
  - Key Components
- ðŸ“ˆ Exporting Telemetry Data
- ðŸ§ª Example Usage
  - <Framework> Application
- ðŸ“š References
